# Awesome WebMCP 🤖 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) [![License: CC0-1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC0_1.0-lightgrey.svg)](LICENSE)

> A curated list of websites, apps, and projects using **WebMCP** (Web Model Context Protocol), plus the SDKs, tools, and resources to build your own.

[WebMCP](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp) is a W3C proposal that lets web applications expose JavaScript-based tools to AI agents and assistive technologies. Sites register tools imperatively with `navigator.modelContext.registerTool()` or declaratively with HTML attributes, so agents can call real functions with full context, auth, and speed instead of scraping or clicking through the UI. The result is collaborative, human-in-the-loop workflows on the same page the human is looking at.

Two browsers implement WebMCP today. **Chrome 146+** shipped it as an [early preview](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webmcp-epp) in February 2026, and the **ChatGPT desktop browser** added support for [WebMCP site tools](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/webmcp) in August 2026. Shopify turned it on for every storefront, Cloudflare added a one-toggle integration, and polyfills and browser extensions make it work everywhere else.

This list focuses on **real websites and apps that ship WebMCP tools**. If you built one, [add it](CONTRIBUTING.md)!
